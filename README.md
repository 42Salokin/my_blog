# My Personal Blog

## Description

This is a personal blog utilizing HTML, CSS, and Javascript to allow me to put a name, title, and content on the first page, submit it and save it to local storage, then be directed to the second page where the input is displayed. It also contains a button to toggle between light and dark mode, and a link to my portfolio.
